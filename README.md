# Elements Form

This is a project I created to demonstrate how to use Angular Elements to create Web Components.

If you want to build and use this make sure you install the dependencies first. The next thing to do is to build the code using the `build:elements` script. Once you have built the project you should get a folder called elements. 

If you look at the test-website/index.html file you'll see there are 2 places that the elements are used. I generally use `http-server` to host my code locally but you can replace that with a local path as well. 

## Angular Generated Documentation

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
